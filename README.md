# One More Gun
One More Gun is a top-down past-paced action game with emphasis on constant picking-up and switching weapons. Taking insperation from series and games such as [Madness Combat](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/58182) and [12 is Better Than 6](https://store.steampowered.com/app/410110/12_is_Better_Than_6) where fast violence and snappy combat is the focus, One More Gun aims to fulfill the vision and idea of such media to make one of the most fun and awesome games in the industry.

# How to run
Before starting the game you are going to need the 'Unity' game engine, as of right now, there is no external .exe file to run the game. In the future, this will not be needed.

To start the game, follow these simple steps:
- Download the files or copy them via the GitHub page
- Open the files in Unity Editor version '2019.4.16'
- Locate the "Game" scene in the 'Scenes' folder (Assets -> Scenes)
- Open the scene and play the scene.

# Scope
One More Gun is a game created for a school project. Limited time and no budget means the scope of the game is realtively small and limited. Development on the game after the project deadline is almost garanteed to end, no matter the state of the game.
